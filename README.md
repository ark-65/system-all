# STUDENT STATUS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR SPRINGBOOT 2

## I want to create a project for java

> I am a front-end developer and I like to write code

> I hope to improve in my spare time

> I donâ€™t want to write business code every day without other improvements, so I want to write a complete program with spring boot so that my previous efforts are not in vain
